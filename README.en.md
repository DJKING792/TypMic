<p align="center">TypMic turns your phone into a wireless microphone for your PC: speak in your phone's browser and the recognized text is typed into your PC's cursor in real time; it supports both Xiaomi MiMo cloud ASR (Chinese / dialects / Chinese-English mix) and local faster-whisper offline mode, stays on your pure LAN with no data leaving your network, and comes with built-in Enter / New-line / Backspace / Clear buttons.</p>

## Compared with similar tools

| Aspect | TypMic (this project) | Most similar tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phone side | Record in the phone browser, scan to start, no app install | Require an app, or depend on a specific phone IME |
| Recognition | Xiaomi MiMo cloud (Chinese / dialects / Chinese-English mix) + local faster-whisper offline mode | Usually a single engine / single option |
| Control keys | Built-in Enter / New-line / Backspace / Clear buttons, standard key events, cross-platform | Often rely on Windows-only AutoHotkey scripts |
| Cross-platform | Works on Windows / macOS / Linux, no platform lock-in | Often Windows-only |
| Network & privacy | Pure LAN, data never leaves your network; offline mode keeps audio fully on-device | Often via public internet / third-party relay |

## How it works

```
Phone browser                PC (runs this service)
    |                              |
    |---- record (HTTPS POST) --->|  /api/transcribe
    |                              |      ↓ ffmpeg → 16 kHz mono wav
    |                              |      ↓ MiMo-V2.5-ASR cloud API   (Cloud Mode)
    |                              |      ↓ faster-whisper local model   (Offline Mode)
    |<--- return transcript -------|      ↓ copy to clipboard + Ctrl+V into cursor

The text is only ever typed into the cursor of **the PC that runs this service**; the phone (or any other LAN device) acts purely as a "wireless microphone".

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) (must be on your `PATH`)
- A PC + a phone on the same Wi-Fi
- A Xiaomi MiMo API key **(Cloud Mode only)** — see [Getting a free MiMo API key](#getting-a-free-mimo-api-key). *Skip this if you use Offline Mode.*

## Quick Start

### Download the project

1. Open the **Releases** page of the GitHub repo.
2. Download the latest archive (e.g. `TypMic-xxx.zip`).
3. Unzip it to any folder.
4. Enter the unzipped **`TypMic`** folder — all the Windows / macOS steps below run from inside it.

### Windows

1. Get a Xiaomi MiMo API key at <https://platform.xiaomimimo.com> (register, then create an API key). *Only needed for Cloud Mode; skip it if you use Offline Mode.*
2. **Allow the firewall first**: right-click `allow_firewall.bat` → "Run as administrator" (opens port 8443; one time only). If the phone later shows "connection refused / ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED", this step was likely skipped.
3. Double-click `start.bat`
   - On first run it creates a virtualenv and installs dependencies automatically.
   - It then **asks you to choose the recognition mode**: `1) Cloud (MiMo)` or `2) Offline (local faster-whisper)`. Offline mode skips the API-key prompt and installs the local ASR dependency automatically; your choice is remembered in `.env` for next time.
   - If you pick Cloud Mode and no key is found, it **prompts you to enter one**, then writes it to `.env` automatically.
4. The screen shows the "phone URL" (e.g. `https://192.168.x.x:8443`) and a QR code.
5. Connect your phone by OS (see [Connect your phone](CONNECT_PHONE.en.md)).
6. Put the PC cursor wherever you want text (Notepad / WeChat / browser…) and just speak into the phone.

### macOS

1. **Install ffmpeg** (for transcoding; pip can't install it): `brew install ffmpeg` (no Homebrew? get it at [brew.sh](https://brew.sh)).
2. **Grant permissions** (System Settings → Privacy & Security): allow **Python** through the Firewall, and enable **Terminal** under Accessibility (else the phone can't connect or text won't type).
3. **`cd` into the project and run it:**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export MIMO_API_KEY=your_key    # or put MIMO_API_KEY=your_key in a .env at the project root
python voice_input_server.py
```

**Offline Mode** (no API key; audio never leaves your Mac): drop the `export MIMO_API_KEY` line above and end with these three instead — the recognition model is downloaded automatically on first run (default `small`):

```bash
pip install faster-whisper
export TYPOMIC_ASR=local
python voice_input_server.py
```

After startup the screen shows the "phone URL" and QR code — then connect your phone (see [Connect your phone](CONNECT_PHONE.en.md)).

## Getting a free MiMo API key

Cloud Mode needs a free Xiaomi MiMo API key. Get one in 3 steps:

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>❓ How much latency is there?</summary>

In **Cloud Mode** a typical utterance (a sentence or two) takes about **1–2 seconds** end-to-end — phone capture + LAN upload + MiMo ASR + paste. In **Offline Mode** it depends on model size and hardware: a `small` model on CPU is usually a few hundred ms to ~1–2 s per utterance; a GPU or `tiny`/`base` model is faster.

</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ How long can a single clip be?</summary>

There is no hard cap, but each "press-and-hold" is one clip. For best accuracy and lowest latency keep a clip to roughly **tens of seconds to a couple of minutes**; long dictation is best done as a series of short clips — the text streams into your cursor continuously.

</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ Does it work without internet?</summary>

**Cloud Mode** needs internet (to reach MiMo's ASR API), but your **audio is only ever sent across your own LAN to the PC** — it never passes through any third-party relay. If you need **zero internet**, enable **Offline Mode** (`TYPOMIC_ASR=local`): recognition runs entirely on your PC and works fully offline.

</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ Is my audio private?</summary>

In Cloud Mode, audio leaves your LAN only to reach Xiaomi's ASR endpoint for transcription, and TypMic stores nothing. In Offline Mode the audio never leaves the PC at all.

</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ The phone can't connect / "connection refused"?</summary>

On startup the server prints detailed diagnostics (IP / ffmpeg / cert / port / key status) — check there. The PC page `https://localhost:8443/desktop` also has a live connection-status view. Most "refused" cases are the firewall blocking port 8443 (see Quick Start).
